## How to Preview

1. Open the project folder in your terminal.
2. If you have Python installed, run a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`.
4. Alternatively, simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser (though some local file restrictions might apply to ES modules if we had used importance, but we used standard script tags so it should work fine).
